# 90-Day DevOps & Cloud Learning Plan

## 1. My Current Level

I am currently a fresher in DevOps.
I have basic understanding of computers and programming but no real-world DevOps experience yet.
I am starting from scratch and building step by step.

## 2. My Understanding of DevOps & Cloud

DevOps is about:

- Automating software build, test, and deployment
- Improving collaboration between developers and operations
- Making systems reliable, scalable, and faster to release

Cloud Engineering is about:

- Using cloud platforms (AWS) instead of physical servers
- Managing servers, networks, storage, and applications in the cloud
- Paying only for what we use
